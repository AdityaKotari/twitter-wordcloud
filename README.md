 A nodejs web app that makes a word cloud using the tweets of a specified profile. 
 
* Demo hosted [here](https://cloud-twitter.herokuapp.com/).

* Pulls up to 3600 tweets from a public user's timeline.

* Uses [amchart](https://www.amcharts.com/) to generate a word-cloud(of the 250 most frequent words).

* Does sentiment analysis for their last 5 tweets.

Starts off at Elon Musk's twitter as an example, but should work for any public twitter account. 

Needs Twitter API keys to run locally.
