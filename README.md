# Twitter-wordcloud

#### Hosted on https://cloud-twitter.herokuapp.com/ - might take a few seconds to load depending on heroku.
 
 
A web-app that 

* Scraps the last 100 tweets from any public twitter account
* Visualizes this in the form of a word cloud
* Provides sentiment analysis of the latest 10 tweets

Starts off at Elon Musk's twitter as an example, but should work for any public twitter account. 

The general processing of text for the wordcloud is a lot simpler than what's used for the sentiment analysis, in order to decrease load times.

Needs Twitter API key to run locally.
